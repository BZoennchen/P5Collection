Hello! I'm Benedikt, an Advisor for Computer Science Education at the [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html) at the Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics. 

I graduated from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/) with a Master's degree in computer science in 2016.
Afterward, I continued my academic journey by joining a PhD program in Computer Science in the field of Pedestrian Dynamics. 
I studied efficient parallel algorithms for pedestrian simulation.
In particular, I discussed and analyzed navigation field computation in a large-scale setting. 
The problem is strongly connected to solving the [eikonal equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eikonal_equation).
Furthermore, I introduced parallelism to the so-called optimal steps models, an important class of microscopic simulation models.
As a consequence, I was able to run large-scale simulations using the GPU.
I did my PhD at the [Chair of Scientific Computing in Computer Science (SCCS)](https://www.in.tum.de/i05/startseite/) of the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/) in cooperation with the [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html).
During that time, I worked as a software developer on the open-source framework for pedestrian simulation [Vadere](http:/www.vadere.org) at the [Pedestrian Research Group](https://www.cs.hm.edu/forschungprojekte/pedestrian_dynamics/index.de.html) in Munich as a developer for the simulation software.

Apart from modeling and simulating pedestrian streams, I am interested in algorithms and their expressiveness in a more general sense.
I want to explore computer coding as an art form in itself and as a musical instrument that generates new forms of expression.
Therefore, it is no surprise that I am drawn to programming art in the form of music using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) or animations using [Processing](https://processing.org/), [P5js](https://p5js.org/) and, more recently [Manim](https://www.manim.community/).
For me, computer science is a door into a world of self-determination, creativity, imagination, beauty, and freedom; in short, 

>"a world open for play" 

to use some words from the great actor and comedian [Robin Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams).

In essence, teaching in the domain of computer science should be an invitation to this playful world.
Since it is so helpful today, we concluded that everyone should know how to code.
However, I firmly believe it can and must be more than useful, especially while we are learning it!
