Hello! I'm Benedikt, a Senior Teaching Assistance at the [Munich University of Applied Sciences (MUAS)](https://www.cs.hm.edu/en/home/index.en.html) at the Faculty of Informatics and Mathematics. 
I graduated from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/cover-page/) with a Master's degree in computer science in 2016.
I continued my academic journey by joining a PhD program in Computer Science in the field of Pedestrian Dynamics. 
During that time, I worked at the [Pedestrian Research Group](https://www.cs.hm.edu/forschungprojekte/pedestrian_dynamics/index.de.html) in Munich. 
Right now, I am waiting for the acceptance of my committed doctoral thesis.

Apart from modeling and simulating pedestrian streams, I am interested in algorithms and their expressiveness in a more general sense.
I want to explore computer coding as an art form in itself and as a musical instrument that generates new forms of expressions.
Therfore, it is no surprise that I am drawn to programming art in the form of music using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) or animations using [Processing](https://processing.org/), [P5js](https://p5js.org/) and mors recently [Manim](https://www.manim.community/).
For me, computer science is a door into a world of self-determination, creativity, imagination, beauty, and freedom; in short, a world open for play - to steal some words from the great actor and comedian [Robin Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams).

In essence, teaching in the domain of computer science should be an invitation to this playful world.
Since it is so useful today, we concluded that programming should be as important as one's secondary language.
However, I firmly believe it can and must be more than useful, especially while learning it!
This belief might be the reason why I enjoy thinking about inspiring and engaging teaching methods for computer science; to show others that it is more than just useful.
