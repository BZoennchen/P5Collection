> The objection that computing is not a science because it studies man-made objects (technologies) is a red herring. Computer science studies information processes both artificial and natural. - Peter J. Denning

For me personally, computer science is an empowering discipline - it is part of the emanzipation of man. It’s engineering quality can directly empower our fragile and limited body and mind. But its magic goes beyond practical usefulness. Similar to mathematics, its beauty can be discovered in an abstract world. This platonian world consists of phantastic imaginative objects we can recognize, build and play with. In it the problems of man are absent. There is no morality, no judgement, no conflict, no othering but harmony to enjoy, complex structures to discover, riddles to unravel and a logic-based creativity to get lost to.

Computer science or informatics is a discipline that is both engineering and formal science.

## Computer Science and Informatics

Let us first dive into the discussion of the two different terms which are often used interchangeable. Let us talk about the differences between informatics and computer science.

### Schooled Computer Science

In Germany, my home country, we prefer the term Informatik (informatics) over Computerwissenschaften (computer science). So it seems natural to me to translate this preference into English. However, in the past this was certainly not the case. Before I studied, I did an apprenticeship as Fachinformatiker (software developer / programmer). This education program focused on practical aspects and felt more like schooling rather than studying. For example, it was more important to know specific things, like the exact configuration possibilities of a browser, rather than understanding general concepts. I was clearly detached from all those specifics but discovered my love for programming - a very important discovery. However, a lot of the remaining lessons and exercises turned into a time sink.

So to distingues between the practical oriented Fachinformatiker and a ‘real’ scientiest, it felt more appropriate to identify myself as a computer scientists. I wanted to draw a line between those two different paths I followed. When talking to friends and familiy about my current experience as a student, I wanted to emphasis that I was no longer the guy that repairs computers and fixes software bugs but a person much more involed into theory, general concepts and actual science. Of course, this justification is a little bit silly and egocentric. However, I was certainly proud to be a student of comptuer science and at this stage being proud translated into being motivated.

Is it ok to be proud of your profession? I think it is, but I am not here to judge. Today, I would no longer use this term ‘proud’ because in my opinion the education I received is a gift and not necessarily an achievement. Nowadays to be proud of anything feels strange to me but this is a topic of another time.

### The Evolution of Computer Science

It is kind of funny that historically, computer scientists also struggeled for recognition on a global scale. In academia this struggle has been gone, but in the eye of the general public the objective and research subject of the discipline is blurred which still leads to confusion. Yes, I am a computer scientist but neither will I fix your computer nor your software bugs!

If we look into the history books, computer scientists had to fight to establish their own field. The discipline emerged out of certain branches such as electrical engineering, physics and mathematics. In the 1960’s, **computer science** come into its own as a discipline. The term was coined by Georg Forsythe, a numerical analyst. The first computer science department was formed at Purdue University in 1962 and the first person to receive a PhD from a computer science department was Richard Wexelblat, at the University of Pennsylvenia, in Decemter 1965.

In Germany, the beginning of **informatics** goes back to the Institude for Practical Mathemtatics (IPM) at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt which was founded around 1928. But it required time to establish the first informatics course by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Darmstadt. The first doctural thesis was written in 1975, ten years later compared to the US. In my hometown the first informatics course at the Technical University of Munich was offered in 1967 at the Department of Mathematics. In 1992, the Department of Informatics split up from the Department of Mathematics.

Compared to other well-established disciplines such as physics, chemistry or psychology, computer science can still be regarded as relatively young. Nonetheless, new disciplines split up from computer sciences and they are all interlinked with one another. We have, for example

* scientific computing,
* computational science,
* information theory,
* and linguistic

and the list goes on. The problem of artifical intelligence (AI) brings computer science more and more in touch with human sciences such as

* philosophy,
* psychology,
* and neurosciences.

### Computer Scientists: do they still exists?

Within the field of computer science there are a lot of branches one can pursue, for example:

* formal methods and complexity theory
* programming languages and compilers
* design and analysis of algorithms and data structures
* parallel and distributed computation
* high-performance computation
* networks and communication
* intelligent systems
* operating systems
* cyber security
* databases
* data science
* computer graphics
* modelling and simulation
* artifical intelligence
* software engineering
* architecture and organization

Over the years some of the branches lost some weight while others gained attraction. For example, we lost interest in operating systems but spent more end more effort into investigating high-performance computation and data science.

This sprawling list of specialities indicates that there is no longer such thing as a classical computer scientists, right? Nobody can be an expert in all of those areas - it is just impossible! For example, for the job market, it is more meaningful to call oneself a specialist in cyber security or data science than a computer scientists.

However, being a computer scientist is more than gaining a knowledge base. It is more than being an expert in some field. It is more than knowing how to large software systems, networks, process data and build a secure infrastructure. For me at least, **it is a way of thinking!**

Both terms **computer science** as well as **informatics** highlight different aspects of this way of thinking.

### Computer Science

The term **computer science** emphasis the importance of computational machines and computation itself. Through that lense
